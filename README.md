# 2DHeatDiffusion
Performs an implicit finite difference method on 2d heat diffusion problem for a unit square with Dirichlet and Thermally insulated boundary conditions. 

To run the code perform following:

git clone the project into a directory

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. mkdir vtk
4. cmake ..
5. make
6. ./2DHeatDiffusion


This will create a vtk file in the vtk directory inside the build directory which can then be visualized
